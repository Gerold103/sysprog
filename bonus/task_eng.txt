Bonus tasks.
Language: C.
Deadline: end of the lecture.
------------------------------------------------------------------

The task is to benchmark some things which appear in daily
programming. To improve understanding of how much they cost.

You can select one of the tasks, do it, present the code and
results right away on the lecture. And if there is time - select a
next task. If there are more people than tasks, then some of the
tasks might be duplicated.

Each benchmark is basically calling some function or functions in
a loop many thousands or even millions of times. You have to
save a timestamp before and after the loop, find the duration, and
print it. To reduce the amount of noise you need to run the
benchmark multiple times and use min, max and median durations as
the result.

For bench parameters you can either try to do it via the command
line arguments or just as const global variables in the code.

For time measurement you have to use
clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC).

## (1) Clock bench
Points: 3.
Bench clock_gettime() with CLOCK_REALTIME, CLOCK_MONOTONIC,
CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW. Run the function with those params 50 mln
times and see how much time it took PER ONE CALL.

## (2) Socket throughput
Points: 6.
Socket throughput for UNIX and TCP socket pair. You have to create
a server with socket() + bind() + listen(). Then connect a client
with connect(). Then accept it with accept(). Now you have a
socket pair. You need to make it non-blocking.

Then either in 2 separate processes or in 2 threads the client
should send some big amount of data in batches, and the server
should receive it all. For example, the client is sending 15 GB in
16 KB packs in each send(). The server calls recv() with 16 KB
buffer. You need to make the total size and pack customizable. And
measure the time to transfer the total size. Try at least
* 15 GB in 16 KB packs;
* 15 GB in 1 KB packs;
* 15 GB in 48 KB packs.
* 15 GB in 512 B packs.

Keep in mind that send() might send less data than it was given.

## (3) Pthread mutex lock
Points: 4.
pthread_mutex_lock/unlock in N threads. You need to start N
threads (customizable number), each is constantly doing mutex
lock/unlock. For each lock you need to increment a global atomic
counter. See how much time it takes to do certain amount of
locks/unlocks depending on thread count, PER ONE LOCK/UNLOCK pair.
Try at least
* 10 mln locks with 1 thread;
* 10 mln locks with 2 threads;
* 10 mln locks with 3 threads.

## (4) Pthread create + join
Points: 2.
You need to create and join a dummy thread with an empty function
some number of times. To see how much time one create+join costs
approximately, PER ONE PAIR. Do it in a loop 100k times, measure
the time per one create+join.

## (5) Atomic increment
Points: 3.
Atomic increment in N threads. You need to start N threads
(customizable number), each is constantly doing atomic lock-free
increment on a certain variable. See how much time it takes to
reach certain value on that variable depending on thread count and
memory order. Try at least
* 100 mln increments with 1 thread and relaxed order;
* 100 mln increments with 3 threads and relaxed order;
* 100 mln increments with 3 threads and sequentially consistent
  order.

## (6) Pthread cond signaling
Points: 4.
Need to measure cost of signal vs broadcast depending on thread
count. You need to start 1 thread doing the signaling and N
threads doing pthread_cond_wait(). The condvar needs to be
protected with a mutex. You need to measure how much time it takes
to make certain number of signaling calls. The signaling thread
need to either call pthread_cond_signal() or
pthread_cond_broadcast(). Depending on bench params. Try at least
these combinations:
* 1 mln signal()s with 1 wait-thread;
* 1 mln broadcast()s with 1 wait-thread;
* 1 mln signal()s with 3 wait-threads;
* 1 mln broadcast()s with 3 wait-threads.

## (7) False sharing
Points: 4.
You need to check how strongly threads can affect each other even
if they don't access the same data. You need to create an array of
uint64_t numbers. And then start N threads. Each thread should
increment its own number in the array in a loop.

Make sure the compiler won't turn the loop into a single +=
operation. For that you can try to add a check on a dummy volatile
variable in the loop's condition.

Assuming the threads are in an array, thread with index A should
use number arr[A]. See how much time it takes for all the threads
to reach certain value of their numbers.

Then make the threads use numbers on a distance from each other.
So thread with index A uses number arr[A * 8]. Distance between
numbers should be at least 64 bytes. Repeat the bench. You need to
try at least the following combinations:
* 100 mln increments with 1 thread;
* 100 mln increments with 2 threads with close numbers;
* 100 mln increments with 2 threads with distant numbers;
* 100 mln increments with 3 threads with close numbers;
* 100 mln increments with 3 threads with distant numbers.
