Shell.
Language: С/C++
Deadline: 3 weeks.
Complexity: ~15 hours on average, 350 lines of code.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Read the whole description. It contains not only the task, but
also hints and some educative materials, time estimations, rules,
points out the common mistakes, and suggests bonus tasks.

-------------------------- Description ---------------------------

You need to implement a simplified version of a command line
console. It should take lines like this:

    > command_name param1 param2 ...

and execute them by calling 'command_name' with the given
parameters. So be a terminal, basically.

The files parser.h and parser.cpp already implement a command
parser for you. You are free to use the given parser or implement
your own or take some other one.

The file parser_test.cpp can be ignored. It is just used for
testing the parser itself. You don't have to submit it, and don't
need to look at it unless you want to just see some examples of
how it works.

The only file of interest for you is solution.cpp which contains
the solution template. But you are free to add more files if
needed.

The behaviour of your terminate must replicate Bash to the letter.
At least in the aspects required by the task and tests.

----------------------------- Rules ------------------------------

- The program should correctly handle quoted strings even if there
  are whitespaces inside it.

- You need to handle comments (by trimming them).

- The console should support pipes expressed as symbol '|' and
  output redirection using '>' and '>>'.

- The program should print all the same what would be printed by a
  real terminal like /bin/bash.

- You need to use functions pipe(), dup/dup2(), fork(), wait(),
  open(), close(), at least one of execl/execle/execlp/execv/execvp/
  execvP().

- The 'cd' command you need to implement yourself, not via 'exec'
  functions. Because it changes the current working directory of
  the terminal itself. Luckily, it is easy to do with the C
  function 'chdir()'.

- The 'exit' command is also special, like 'cd'. Because it
  concerns the terminal itself. It needs to be implemented
  manually. But keep in mind that it should exit from the terminal
  itself only under special condition: its output must be to the
  shell. If it gets redirected, then it doesn't kill the shell.
  For example, 'exit', 'exit 123 && echo test',
  'exit 456 || echo test' - all terminate the shell. But
  'exit | echo 100' - will not terminate. When in doubt, test the
  behaviour with /bin/bash. Your shell must follow the same.

- Your console should support tokens written without spaces when
  /bin/bash is able to parse them too. Like this:
  'echo "4">file' (works same as 'echo "4" > file'), or
  'echo 100|grep 100' (works same as 'echo 100 | grep 100').

- When something is unclear how it should work, you should test it
  in the real console like /bin/bash and repeat the behaviour.

- The code should be built successfully with these compiler flags:
  `-Wextra -Werror -Wall -Wno-gnu-folding-constant`.

-------------------------- Restrictions --------------------------

- Global variables are not allowed (except for the already
  existing ones).

- Memory leaks are not allowed. To check them you can build with
  the cmake option `ENABLE_LEAK_CHECKS`. Showing zero leak reports
  from Valgrind or ASAN is not enough - they often miss the leaks.

- Length of command line input is not limited, so you can't read
  it into a buffer of a fixed size. But each line obviously fits
  into the main memory.

- It is forbidden to use functions like system(), popen() or use
  any other way to access existing shell-like ready-to-use
  functions.

-------------------------- Relaxations ---------------------------

- You don't need to support redirect of specific output streams,
  like stderr. These commands: 1>, 2>, $>, 1>>, and alike are not
  needed. (Usual > and >> still are needed.)

- No need to support multiple redirects like
  'cmd > file1 > file2' or 'cmd > file1 file2'.

- You don't need to support '~' nor '-' paths in 'cd' command.

- You can use an already existing parser defined in parser.h and
  .cpp files, with usage shown in solution.cpp.

- You can assume, that memory allocation functions like
  new/delete/malloc()/realloc()/calloc() never fail.

----------------------- Possible solutions -----------------------

- 15 points: all described above.

- +5 points: support &.

- +5 points: support operators && and ||. Keep in mind that this
  bonus is relatively hard to implement.

The additional options for +5 points do not include each other.
That is, you can do none, or do only one, or do only another, or
both for +10.

Input: commands and their arguments, input/output redirection operators.

Output: the same what a real Bash prints.

--------------------------- Complexity ---------------------------

How much time and effort it would take to do this task. The
numbers might help you with planning. They are are gathered on the
people who completed the task at least with the minimal points.

- Lines of code: 200-450, average 350.

- Required total time:
  * Advanced level: ~10 hours.
  * Average:        ~15 hours.
  * Struggling:     ~20 hours and more.

- Time distribution: the coding and debugging seem to be rather
  even. There isn't much code to write actually, but you would
  have to debug probably a lot.

--------------------------- How to run ---------------------------

The task uses CMake for compilation. Here is how you could use it.

- Go into the task's folder, so your path is <...>/sysprog/2/.
- Create a build folder and go there:
    mkdir build
    cd build
- Configure the project:
    cmake ..
- Compile it:
    make
- Now you can run your shell via:
    ./mybash

CMake offers you a few options. Each option, like SOME_OPTION, you
can set to a certain value using the following syntax:
    cmake -DSOME_OPTION=value ..

The options available for this task are:

- ENABLE_LEAK_CHECKS - build with heap_help utility to check if
    you have any leaks or heap misusages.
  - 0 = disable. Default.
  - 1 = enable

- ENABLE_GLOB_SEARCH - build all the C and C++ source files in the
    folder. It is mostly needed when you have created more files
    for yourself and don't watch to list them all individually.
  - 0 = disable. Default.
  - 1 = enable

- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.
  - Release = enable compiler optimizations. Faster, but not much
      possible to debug interactively.
  - Debug = disable compiler optimizations. Slower, but good for
      interactive debugging.

------------------------- Input examples -------------------------

Input examples:

* Print process list and find 'init' string in them:

    > ps aux | grep init

* Execute code in python and search a string in its output:

    > echo "print('result is ', 123 + 456)" | python -i | grep result

* Print escaped quote into a file and print it:

    > echo "some text\" with quote" > test.txt
    > cat test.txt

* Append to a file:

    > echo "first data" > test.txt
    > echo "second" >> test.txt
    > cat test.txt

* Start an interactive python console and do something in it:

    > python
    >>> print(1 + 2)
    >>> 3

----------------------- Advices and hints ------------------------

- Try to implement a simple main.cpp file with just one hardcoded
  command being executed with fork() + exec...().

  Then try to extend it. For example, connect 2 hardcoded
  commands via a single pipe, like `echo abc | grep a`. Use
  fork() + exec...() + pipe() + dup2() to make output of one
  command go into the input of the second one.

  Once it works, try to add a third command to them:
  `echo abc | grep a | cat`, for example. You would need 3 forks,
  2 pipes, and a few dup2() calls. Once this works, you will see a
  pattern, how to make it work for any number of pipes.

- Before starting your solution code, get familiar with the
  parser's API.

- In the beginning implement command execution without |, >, >>.
  Just one command.

- The tests in tests.txt you can edit for debugging. Or copy-paste
  them into your interactive terminal for manual debug. Try for
  example to check if just the first tests in tests.txt are
  working via checker.py, by deleting the rest of them.

- Add support for |, >, >>. One by one. It is better to be
  iterative in your work. Don't try to implement everything at
  once. Nobody does that in real production development. Features
  are added gradually.

- Try asking ChatGPT or another AI general Bash questions, pipes,
  forks, execs. Most of the time those chat-bots can be helpful.

- Use the actual /bin/bash for testing how something should work.
  Note that your default terminal might be not Bash, especially
  if you work on Mac. Better explicitly run /bin/bash binary. In
  there run your tests that you would like to know how they work.

- If struggling with `exit` command support and the exit codes,
  you can check the Bash exit codes using `echo $?`. It will print
  the exit code of the last executed command. And then you just
  repeat that behaviour in your own terminal.

- When trying to pass tests, do not forget to remove or
  comment out the debug messages. They would make your output not
  identical to Bash, and the tests would fail.

- When debugging, you would probably find it hard to do via gdb or
  lldb, because they aren't very nice for multiprocess debugging.
  You would have to use printf(). To simplify it you might want
  to wrap it into a macros like `#define mylog printf`, to quickly
  disable it via `#define mylog(...)` (thus defining the logs into
  the void) before actual testing with checker.py.

  Also some logs in child processes you probably won't see if
  write them to STDOUT with printf(), because obviously some of
  STDOUTs would be redirected. It might help then to write your
  logs into some file by a hardcoded path in your solution folder.
  So all processes would write to it their logs, and won't mess
  their STDOUT outputs up.

- Be very careful about closing the pipes correctly. Remember,
  that if you forget to close the reading end of a pipe, then the
  writer will eventually hang. And vice versa. Also remember, that
  if you create a pipe(int[2]) and then call fork(), then now both
  the parent and child have 2 descriptors, 4 in total. It is best
  to right away close the not needed ends of the pipe in each
  process.

- Try to increase the file descriptor limit in your console if
  getting strange errors about pipes not opening (see `ulimit -n`
  command) (also possible that you forgot to close the unused ends
  of your pipes somewhere).

Architecture of the solution may be the following: there is a
process-terminal, which reads user commands. On each command it
does fork(). The new child executes the command using exec*()
functions. The parent process waits for the child termination.

For each | the terminal opens a pipe, which is used to link input
of one child and output of another.

For > and >> the terminal opens a file, and using dup/dup2()
changes standard output for the child, so it will write to that
file.
