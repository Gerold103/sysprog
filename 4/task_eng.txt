also hints and some educative materials, time estimations, rules,
points out the common mistakes, and suggests bonus tasks.

-------------------------- Description ---------------------------

Need to implement a thread pool. In various programs executing
many independent and easily parallelized tasks it is often quite
handy to distribute them across multiple threads. But creating a
thread for each necessity to execute something in parallel is
very expensive in time and resources. If a task is not too long,
doesn't read disk, doesn't touch network, then creation/deletion
of a thread might take more time than the task itself.

Then tasks are either not paralleled at all, or when there are
many of them, people make thread pools. It is usually a task queue
and a few so called "worker threads" which take tasks from the
queue. Thus there is always an already created thread which can
quickly pick up a task. And instead of exiting the thread simply
picks up a next task.

In big general purpose libraries often there is an out of the box
solution: in Qt it is QThreadPool class, in .NET it is ThreadPool
class, in boost it is thread_pool class. In the task you have to
implement an own similar pool.

In the files thread_pool.h and thread_pool.cpp you can find
templates of functions and structures which need to be
implemented.

The thread pool is described by a struct thread_pool implemented
in thread_pool.cpp. A user can only have a pointer at it. Each
task/job is described with struct thread_task, which a user can
create and put into the pool's queue.

User can check task's status (waits for getting a worker; is
already being executed), can wait for its end and get its result
with thread_task_join, similar to how pthread_join works.

Since the task is to implement a library, there is no 'main'
function and no input from anywhere. You can write tests in C in a
separate file with 'main' and which will 'include' your solution.
For example, make a file main.cpp, add 'include "thread_pool.h"',
and in the function 'main' you do tests. It can all be built like
this:

        gcc thread_pool.cpp main.cpp

----------------------------- Rules ------------------------------

- thread_pool at creation via thread_pool_new() shouldn't start
  all max number of threads at once. The threads have to be
  started gradually when needed, until reach the limit specified
  in thread_pool_new().

- Joined but not yet deleted tasks can be re-pushed back into the
  pool.

- The other rules can be read in the documentation in
  thread_pool.h and deducted from the tests.

-------------------------- Restrictions --------------------------

- Global variables are not allowed (except for the already
  existing ones).

- Memory leaks are not allowed. To check them you can build with
  the cmake option `ENABLE_LEAK_CHECKS`. Showing zero leak reports
  from Valgrind or ASAN is not enough - they often miss the leaks.

- The code should have zero busy loops or sleep loops. These are
  only allowed in tests. I.e. in thread_task_join() you can't
  just do 'while (!task->is_finished) {usleep(1)};'. For waiting
  on anything you need to use pthread_cond_t.

-------------------------- Relaxations ---------------------------

- There is no limit on the number of mutexes and condvars. You
  can even store them in each task.

- You can assume, that memory allocation functions like
  new/delete/malloc()/realloc()/calloc() never fail.

----------------------- Possible solutions -----------------------

- 15 points: implement all functions from thread_pool.h, which are
  not hidden inside macros.

- +5 points: implement thread_task_detach(). The documentation is
  in thread_pool.h. You need to define the macro NEED_DETACH to 1
  then.

- +5 points: implement thread_task_timed_join(). The documentation
  is in thread_pool.h. You need to define the macro
  NEED_TIMED_JOIN to 1 then.

The additional options for +5 points do not include each other.
That is, you can do none, or do only one, or do only another, or
both for +10.

--------------------------- Complexity ---------------------------

How much time and effort it would take to do this task. The
numbers might help you with planning. They are are gathered on the
people who completed the task at least with the minimal points.

- Lines of code: 250-400, average 330.

- Required total time:
  * Advanced level: ~6 hours.
  * Average:       ~10 hours.
  * Struggling:    ~19 hours and more.

- Time distribution:
  * Active coding: ~2-4 hours.
  * The rest is mostly debugging. It can be tricky in
      multithreaded environment.

--------------------------- How to run ---------------------------

The task uses CMake for compilation. Here is how you could use it.

- Go into the task's folder, so your path is <...>/sysprog/4/.
- Create a build folder and go there:
    mkdir build
    cd build
- Configure the project:
    cmake ..
- Compile it:
    make
- Now you can run the tests via:
    ./test

CMake offers you a few options. Each option, like SOME_OPTION, you
can set to a certain value using the following syntax:
    cmake -DSOME_OPTION=value ..

The options available for this task are:

- ENABLE_LEAK_CHECKS - build with heap_help utility to check if
    you have any leaks or heap misusages.
  - 0 = disable. Default.
  - 1 = enable

- ENABLE_GLOB_SEARCH - build all the C and C++ source files in the
    folder. It is mostly needed when you have created more files
    for yourself and don't watch to list them all individually.
  - 0 = disable. Default.
  - 1 = enable

- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.
  - Release = enable compiler optimizations. Faster, but not much
      possible to debug interactively.
  - Debug = disable compiler optimizations. Slower, but good for
      interactive debugging.

----------------------- Advices and hints ------------------------

- Try to ask ChatGPT or another AI about some theory if you are
  struggling with the basic concepts.

- It is vital that you understand the following: what is a thread,
  what is a mutex, and what is a condition variable.

  Thread is basically an executor. Something that can run code.
  When you have multiple threads, they can run the same or
  different code literally in parallel, on multiple physical CPU
  cores.

  Mutex is a way to protect some data from being accessed by
  multiple threads at once. It is needed when you need to update
  or read some untrivial state (multiple variables at once or do
  multiple actions with one variable like an increment) and it
  can't be done in a single machine instruction. Then you do
  mutex-lock, do the work, and mutex-unlock. Between the lock and
  unlock only one thread will be able to work.

  Condition variable is a way to block a thread so it could wait
  for a certain "event" or a "condition". Hence the name -
  "condition variable". How it works is that one thread takes a
  mutex-lock, checks a certain condition, sees that it is not
  satisfied, and waits on that condition. Another thread will
  eventually take the mutex-lock and "signal" this condition.
  This will make the first thread wakeup. And then it can
  double-check that the condition is indeed satisfied. You can try
  to search some examples in the Internet to see specific
  usecases.

- When making the detach-bonus, pay special attention to the case
  what happens when one thread calls detach and at the same time
  the task is finished in the worker. It is quite easy to make a
  memory leak or a use-after-free here. You need to make sure that
  if detach is called, then either the task is already finished
  and gets deleted, or it will be deleted automatically when it is
  finished.

- When heap_help is enabled, the tests might run for a relatively
  long time. For the sake of faster debugging you might want to
  reduce the TPOOL_MAX_TASKS constant. Just make sure it is
  reverted back to its original value before you submit the final
  solution.
