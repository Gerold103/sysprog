Game lobby chat.
Language: C.
Deadline: 2 weeks.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Need to implement a game lobby chat. It consists of a chat server
and a client.

The clients connect to the server and each message is broadcasted
to all the clients via this server. So the server is like a game
lobby. Everyone reads all messages from all the others and the
messages are not persisted anyhow.

In the attached .h and .c files you can find templates of
functions and structures which need to be implemented.

A usage example of the exe files is that you start a server,
start one or more clients, and everything sent by anybody is
displayed in all clients. Like so:

$> ./server             $> ./client             $> ./client
I am client-1!          I am client-1!          I am client-1!
I am client-2!          I am client-2!          I am client-2!


Rules:

- Message end is `\n` (line wrap). Note, that '\n' is not a part
  of the message. It is just a delimiter. I.e. if feed('msg\n') is
  called, then the peers should return 'msg' from pop(). Note also
  that feed() can get multiple messages or even their parts:
  - feed('msg1\nmsg2\n') - pop() returns 'msg1' and 'msg2';
  - feed('msg1\nms') - pop() returns 'msg1'. 'ms' remains buffered
    until meets the next '\n'.

- Own messages are not sent back to the client.

- Empty messages (consisting of just spaces - see isspace()
  function) are not sent at all.

- Each message is trimmed from any spaces at both left and right
  sides. For example, if I type "  m s   g   " in a terminal and
  press enter, the message to be sent should be "m s   g".


Restrictions:

- Global variables are not allowed (except for the already
  existing ones).

- Memory leaks are not allowed. To check them you can use
  utils/heap_help tool. Showing zero leak reports from Valgrind or
  ASAN is not enough - they often miss the leaks.

- You should not use sleep()/usleep() or any similar function
  anywhere. All waiting for anything has to be done using epoll or
  poll or kqueue.

- Function select() is forbidden (it is outdated, broken by design
  and is just bad practice - never use it).

- All sockets should be created in non-blocking mode (O_NONBLOCK).

- No busy-loops of any sort anywhere.

- Be ready that send/write and other output functions can send
  just a part of data. For example, send(100) can return 60.

- The API in the headers can not be changed (unless you spot a
  mistake there - then tell me).

- You can use libev if you feel it will be easier than direct
  usage of epoll/kqueue (but honestly it is unlikely).

- In epoll you have to use epoll_event.data.ptr and in kqueue -
  kevent.udata. Note, usage of epoll_event.data.fd is not allowed.
  The ptr/udata must be used for matching events to their sockets
  after return from epoll_wait() and kevent().

- When epoll is used, you have to read about EPOLLET and use it.
  Usage of EPOLL_CTL_MOD is not allowed.

- When kqueue is used, you have to use EV_CLEAR.

- The attached makefile should keep working and compilation should
  have zero warnings/errors. Alternatively you can try to use
  cmake, but then need to keep all the same compiler options.


Relaxations:

- Can assume message queues are always small enough to fit into
  the memory.

- Can assume all input and output buffers always fit into the
  memory.

- Can use abort() for critical errors like when an epoll or socket
  descriptor couldn't be created, or malloc() fails.

- You can store output buffer in any format. For example, copy
  each message passed to feed() and store those in a list. Or copy
  every message into a single big buffer to the end.

- Client count is never too big. Peer-sockets and memory for their
  resources are always enough on the server.

- You can assume the client and server operate only on IPv4
  addresses.


Advices:

- Start with a design of what you want to do. For example, you
  need to think how to push data into the sockets - write()/send()
  can send not all given data at once. Like write(100) can easily
  write just 60 bytes. It means data for sending must be saved
  into some buffer from which it will be sent in portions when the
  socket is writable. You have to copy data for sending, and track
  how much of it was sent.

- Choose what you will use in the server - epoll, poll, or kqueue.
  I highly recommend epoll/kqueue but you can use any of these 3
  methods (note, kqueue is only available on Mac/FreeBSD and epoll
  is only available on Linux).

- You might want to start with the client. It is easier than the
  server.

- If you feel confident with the basics, you might want to right
  away try to support client names (see a bonus point below).


Possible solutions:

- 15 points: implement all functions from all .h and .c files,
  like described above and in the files (except optional ones,
  from the bonus sections below).

- +5 points: support client names. In chat_client_new() there is a
  parameter 'name'. It has to be sent to server and be displayed
  before each message of that client in all the other clients. If
  doing this, you need to define the macro NEED_AUTHOR.

  For this bonus to be accepted the clients should send their name
  to the server only once.

- +5 points: implement server's messages - the function
  chat_server_feed(). It is already defined in chat_server.h and
  .c files. If doing this, you need to define the macro
  NEED_SERVER_FEED.

  Server messages are broadcast to all clients. If you did the
  client names bonus, then server name should be 'server'.

- -5 points: (yes, minus, not plus) - you can use C++ and STL
  containers.

The additional options for +5 points do not include each other.
That is, you can do none, or do only one, or do only another, or
both for +10. Or use C++ and get -5 to your sum.
