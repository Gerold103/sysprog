Read the whole description. It contains not only the task, but
also hints and some educative materials, time estimations, rules,
points out the common mistakes, and suggests bonus tasks.

-------------------------- Description ---------------------------

Need to implement a game lobby chat. It consists of a chat server
and a client.

The clients connect to the server and each message is broadcasted
to all the clients via this server. So the server is like a game
lobby. Everyone reads all messages from all the others and the
messages are not persisted anyhow.

In the attached .h and .cpp files you can find templates of
functions and structures which need to be implemented.

A usage example of the exe files is that you start a server,
start one or more clients, and everything sent by anybody is
displayed in all clients. Like so:

$> ./server             $> ./client             $> ./client
I am client-1!          I am client-1!          I am client-1!
I am client-2!          I am client-2!          I am client-2!

----------------------------- Rules ------------------------------

- Message end is `\n` (line wrap). Note, that '\n' is not a part
  of the message. It is just a delimiter. I.e. if feed('msg\n') is
  called, then the peers should return 'msg' from pop(). Note also
  that feed() can get multiple messages or even their parts:
  - feed('msg1\nmsg2\n') - pop() returns 'msg1' and 'msg2';
  - feed('msg1\nms') - pop() returns 'msg1'. 'ms' remains buffered
    until meets the next '\n'.

- Own messages are not sent back to the client.

- Empty messages (consisting of just spaces - see isspace()
  function) are not sent at all.

- Each message is trimmed from any spaces at both left and right
  sides. For example, if I type "  m s   g   " in a terminal and
  press enter, the message to be sent should be "m s   g".

-------------------------- Restrictions --------------------------

- Global variables are not allowed (except for the already
  existing ones).

- Memory leaks are not allowed. To check them you can build with
  the cmake option `ENABLE_LEAK_CHECKS`. Showing zero leak reports
  from Valgrind or ASAN is not enough - they often miss the leaks.

- You should not use sleep()/usleep() or any similar function
  anywhere. All waiting for anything has to be done using epoll or
  poll or kqueue.

- Function select() is forbidden (it is outdated, broken by design
  and is just bad practice - never use it).

- All sockets should be working in non-blocking mode (O_NONBLOCK).
  On the client-side though it is allowed to make a socket
  non-blocking after connect(). So the connect() is allowed to be
  blocking.

- No busy-loops of any sort anywhere.

- Be ready that send/write and other output functions can send
  just a part of data. For example, send(100) can return 60.

- The API in the headers can not be changed (unless you spot a
  mistake there - then tell me).

- In epoll you have to use epoll_event.data.ptr and in kqueue -
  kevent.udata. Note, usage of epoll_event.data.fd is not allowed.
  The ptr/udata must be used for matching events to their sockets
  after return from epoll_wait() and kevent().

- When epoll is used, you have to read about EPOLLET and use it.
  Usage of EPOLL_CTL_MOD is not allowed. Usage of
  EPOLL_CTL_ADD/DEL to simulate MOD is also not allowed. A socket
  must be added to epoll once when created, and deleted before
  being closed. This specifically means you **can't** use
  epoll_ctl() on the same socket more than 2 times - to add it and
  to delete from the epoll. Same about kqueue.

- When kqueue is used, you have to use EV_CLEAR. All the same
  restrictions apply same as with epoll. That is, you can't add
  and delete the events. You must add socket once and leave it
  in kqueue until it is closed.

- On server side you must use epoll or kqueue.

- On the client side you must use poll() (not epoll).

- The attached makefile should keep working and compilation should
  have zero warnings/errors. Alternatively you can try to use
  cmake, but then need to keep all the same compiler options.

- You can not use `malloc()`, `realloc()`, `calloc()`, and so on.
  You can only use `new` and `delete` from C++.

-------------------------- Relaxations ---------------------------

- Can assume message queues are always small enough to fit into
  the memory.

- Can assume all input and output buffers always fit into the
  memory.

- Can use abort() for critical errors like when an epoll or socket
  descriptor couldn't be created.

- You can assume, that memory allocation functions `new` and
  `delete` never fail.

- You can store output buffer in any format. For example, copy
  each message passed to feed() and store those in a list. Or copy
  every message into a single big buffer to the end.

- Client count is never too big. Peer-sockets and memory for their
  resources are always enough on the server.

- You can assume the client and server operate only on IPv4
  addresses.

----------------------- Possible solutions -----------------------

- 15 points: implement all functions from all .h and .cpp files,
  like described above and in the files (except optional ones,
  from the bonus sections below).

- +5 points: support client names. In chat_client_new() there is a
  parameter 'name'. It has to be sent to server and be displayed
  before each message of that client in all the other clients. If
  doing this, you need to define the macro NEED_AUTHOR.

  For this bonus to be accepted the clients should send their name
  to the server only once.

  This bonus is better be planned to have in advance. Otherwise
  you would have to change a lot of code after the base is done.

- +5 points: implement server's messages - the function
  chat_server_feed(). It is already defined in chat_server.h and
  .cpp files. If doing this, you need to define the macro
  NEED_SERVER_FEED.

  Server messages are broadcast to all clients. If you did the
  client names bonus, then server name should be 'server'.

The additional options for +5 points do not include each other.
That is, you can do none, or do only one, or do only another, or
both for +10.

--------------------------- Complexity ---------------------------

How much time and effort it would take to do this task. The
numbers might help you with planning. They are are gathered on the
people who completed the task at least with the minimal points.

- Lines of code: 1000-1200, average 1100.

- Required total time:
  * Advanced level: ~6 hours.
  * Average:       ~15 hours.
  * Struggling:    ~20 hours and more.

- Time distribution:
  * Active coding: ~6 hours.
  * The rest is reading the code, understanding the task, reading
      the documentation on the descriptor multiplexing methods
      like epoll/kqueue.

--------------------------- How to run ---------------------------

The task uses CMake for compilation. Here is how you could use it.

- Go into the task's folder, so your path is <...>/sysprog/5/.
- Create a build folder and go there:
    mkdir build
    cd build
- Configure the project:
    cmake ..
- Compile it:
    make
- Now you can run the tests via:
    ./test
- And the client and server respectively via:
    ./client
    ./server

CMake offers you a few options. Each option, like SOME_OPTION, you
can set to a certain value using the following syntax:
    cmake -DSOME_OPTION=value ..

The options available for this task are:

- ENABLE_LEAK_CHECKS - build with heap_help utility to check if
    you have any leaks or heap misusages.
  - 0 = disable. Default.
  - 1 = enable

- ENABLE_GLOB_SEARCH - build all the C and C++ source files in the
    folder. It is mostly needed when you have created more files
    for yourself and don't watch to list them all individually.
  - 0 = disable. Default.
  - 1 = enable

- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.
  - Release = enable compiler optimizations. Faster, but not much
      possible to debug interactively.
  - Debug = disable compiler optimizations. Slower, but good for
      interactive debugging.

----------------------- Advices and hints ------------------------

- Start with a design of what you want to do. For example, you
  need to think how to push data into the sockets - write()/send()
  can send not all given data at once. Like write(100) can easily
  write just 60 bytes. It means data for sending must be saved
  into some buffer from which it will be sent in portions when the
  socket is writable. You have to copy data for sending, and track
  how much of it was sent.

- See what you will use in the server - epoll or kqueue. If you
  have Linux, then it is will be epoll. If Mac, then you might
  use kqueue natively, or use epoll in a Linux VM or in a Docker
  container.

- You might want to start with the client. It is easier than the
  server.

- If you feel confident with the basics, you might want to right
  away try to support client names.

- It is highly recommended to investigate how EPOLLET works when
  you are going to use epoll, and EV_CLEAR when using kqueue. The
  idea is the same for both but can be easier explained on the
  epoll case, because the name is more matching. EPOLLET stands
  for "edge-triggered" mode. While the default mode is
  "level-triggered".

  The difference is the following. The level-triggered epoll works
  quite trivial. If a user listens for EPOLLIN and a socket is
  readable, then epoll_wait() will return that socket while it
  remains readable. Same with EPOLLOUT - the socket will be
  returned from epoll_wait() all the time, as long as it is
  writable.

  And this is problematic. While reading is usually needed all the
  time, writing is not. Because not always the application has
  something to write. And yet, epoll_wait() will all the time
  return this socket even when the app has no data for sending.

  This is why "level-triggered" mode is called like this - event
  is triggered when the socket is at the "level" of being
  readable or writable. It depends on the socket's current state
  and nothing else.

  "Edge-triggered" mode is different. It only reacts (creates an
  "event") when the socket changes its state. So it tracks not the
  state itself, but its changes.

  And this is how it gets reflected - when a socket **wasn't**
  writable and **becomes** writable, then EPOLLOUT event is
  delivered from epoll_wait(). But if the socket was already
  writable before epoll_wait(), then it won't be returned from it.
  Same with reading and with EPOLLIN.

  The transition to **not having a state** happens when you tried
  to consume the state (you did send() for writing and recv() for
  reading) and got EWOULDBLOCK error. Then when the state
  **appears**, you will get an event about it.

  So with EPOLLET just always make sure that you do try to
  write()/send() when you didn't get any EWOULDBLOCK since the
  last epoll_wait() call. If it is not writable and you get
  EWOULDBLOCK, you will be notified when it becomes such by
  EPOLLOUT.

  For EPOLLIN the logic is the same, but usually it is easier,
  because you always want this event. It is very rare when an app
  doesn't want to read a socket.

  With kqueue all the same applies when EV_CLEAR is used.
