Coroutine messaging system
Language: С/C++
Deadline: 3 weeks.
Complexity: ~10 hours on average, 500 lines of code.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Read the whole description. It contains not only the task, but
also hints and some educative materials, time estimations, rules,
points out the common mistakes, and suggests bonus tasks.

-------------------------- Description ---------------------------

There is a messaging object called bus, like on a motherboard. The
bus allows to open channels which can be used for sending trivial
messages.

Need to implement this bus messaging object with coroutine
support.

Coroutine, also known as a co-program, a light thread, a virtual
thread, a green thread, a fiber, is a unit of the program flow.
It runs linear code and has a stack, same as a regular thread, but
it can't be scheduled by the kernel. Instead, the coroutines are
user space objects, and they are scheduled entirely by the user
space. The simplest setup is when one thread has many coroutines
inside and can run them in turns.

The coroutines themselves are already implemented, and the bus'
idea is very simple. The main challenge is to make the bus
compatible with these coroutines.

For instance, the bus channel has a size limit. When a coroutine
tries to send a message into the channel and the size limit is
reached, the coroutine must be suspended until there is space in
the channel.

The tests are in test.cpp. The implementation template is in
corobus.h and corobus.cpp. The coroutines API is in libcoro.h. The
other files you don't need to work with. Except for when want to
check out the internals of the tests or of the coroutines. For
example, libcoro_test.cpp just tests the coroutines engine. The
task doesn't require to change anything in that engine. Just use
the API.

----------------------------- Rules ------------------------------

- Need to strictly follow the behaviour of each function explained
  in corobus.h comments.

- The provided tests must all pass.

- The code should be built successfully with these compiler flags:
  `-Wextra -Werror -Wall -Wno-gnu-folding-constant`.

-------------------------- Restrictions --------------------------

- Global variables are not allowed (except for the already
  existing ones).

- Memory leaks are not allowed. To check them you can build with
  the cmake option `ENABLE_LEAK_CHECKS`. Showing zero leak reports
  from Valgrind or ASAN is not enough - they often miss the leaks.

- You can not use `malloc()`, `realloc()`, `calloc()`, and so on.
  You can only use `new` and `delete` from C++.

- Can not change test.cpp, libcoro.cpp, libcoro.h.

-------------------------- Relaxations ---------------------------

- You can assume, that memory allocation functions `new` and
  `delete` never fail.

- Use can use intrusive list container defined in utils/rlist.h.

----------------------- Possible solutions -----------------------

- 15 points: pass all the basic tests.

- +5 points: implement 'broadcast'. To enable broadcast tests you
  should define the macro NEED_BROADCAST to 1 in corobus.h. The
  tests must pass. Refer to corobus.h header to see what the
  broadcast functions should be doing.

- +5 points: batch send/recv. To enable the corresponding tests
  you should define the macro NEED_BATCH to 1 in corobus.h. The
  tests must pass. Refer to corobus.h header to see what the batch
  functions should be doing.

The additional options for +5 points do not include each other.
That is, you can do none, or do only one, or do only another, or
both for +10.

--------------------------- Complexity ---------------------------

How much time and effort it would take to do this task. The
numbers might help you with planning. They are are gathered on the
people who completed the task at least with the minimal points.

- Lines of code: 350-700, average 500.

- Required total time:
  * Advanced level: ~6 hours.
  * Average:       ~10 hours.
  * Struggling:    ~19 hours and more.

- Time distribution:
  * Active coding: ~2-4 hours.
  * The rest is reading the code, understanding the task and the
      coroutines, debugging.

--------------------------- How to run ---------------------------

The task uses CMake for compilation. Here is how you could use it.

- Go into the task's folder, so your path is <...>/sysprog/1/.
- Create a build folder and go there:
    mkdir build
    cd build
- Configure the project:
    cmake ..
- Compile it:
    make
- Now you can run the tests via:
    ./test

CMake offers you a few options. Each option, like SOME_OPTION, you
can set to a certain value using the following syntax:
    cmake -DSOME_OPTION=value ..

The options available for this task are:

- ENABLE_LEAK_CHECKS - build with heap_help utility to check if
    you have any leaks or heap misusages.
  - 0 = disable. Default.
  - 1 = enable

- ENABLE_GLOB_SEARCH - build all the C and C++ source files in the
    folder. It is mostly needed when you have created more files
    for yourself and don't watch to list them all individually.
  - 0 = disable. Default.
  - 1 = enable

- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.
  - Release = enable compiler optimizations. Faster, but not much
      possible to debug interactively.
  - Debug = disable compiler optimizations. Slower, but good for
      interactive debugging.

----------------------- Advices and hints ------------------------

- Try to inspect the libcoro_test.cpp and test.cpp to see how the
  coroutines are used. Try to run libcoro_test.cpp, add some
  prints, use a debugger, to see how what works.

- Read libcoro.h to see what kind of API you have available. See
  what could be used in your solutions for which things.

- Try asking ChatGPT or another AI about what are the coroutines,
  if you need more info about the whole concept of a "coroutine".

- The coroutines in the task are very similar to goroutines in Go
  language. And the "corobus" object is very similar to Go
  channels.

- Once you understand the libcoro coroutines, try to design your
  solution. In your head at first, then write it down as text. Do
  not start coding until you know what to code. Think first, code
  second.

- Implement firstly 'try_send', 'try_recv', and others 'try'. They
  do not block the current coroutine, which makes them quite
  trivial. Then try to implement 'send' via 'try_send', 'recv' via
  'try_recv', and so on.

A further note on the coroutines. If struggling to grasp what they
are, try another angle - think of them as "resumable functions".

Each coroutine has a function as its body (given in coro_new()).
This function can call other functions and in general works like
any other code. But this resumable function can be paused. It
happens when you yield (call coro_yield()). And then can be
resumed (call coro_wakeup()).

For instance, one can start coroutine-1, it does some work, gets
paused, then coroutine-2 is created and works, then is paused,
then coroutine-1 continues work until pause, and so on.

The coroutines are like objects. Literally structs. One process,
one thread can have many of them. And you as a user of the
coroutines can choose which of those function-objects you resume
or pause and when.

Remember, that this is all a single thread. The coroutines in this
task are executed in turns, and are never running literally
parallel. Concurrent, but not parallel. Mutexes or any other
synchronization methods are not necessary here.
